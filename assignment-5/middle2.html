        <p>
            Space systems are vehicles and infrastructure working together to perform a task in the space environment.
           We depend on space systems every day for communication, navigation and weather prediction services. 
           Space systems improve our knowledge of the physical universe through celestial observation and planetary exploration. 
           Space systems also provide intelligence and surveillance that is critical for the national defense.
           Space systems typically exhibit high levels of subsystem interaction, have low design and performance margins, and require high reliability.
            Autonomy is increasingly important for space systems, particularly for those operating far from Earth.
